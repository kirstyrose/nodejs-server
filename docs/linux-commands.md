# Common Linux commands

You spend a lot of time in the terminal when using Node.js

Pro tip: with Node.js, always work from your project route, never move into a sub directory

1. `cd` change directory `cd Desktop/`
2. `mkdir` creates a directory `mkdir docs`
3. `touch` creates a blank file `touch index.js`
4. `mv` moves a file `mv docs/index.md docs/nodejs.md`
5. `rm -f` deletes a file `rm -f hello.js`
  `rm -rf` recursive file directories removed also, be careful using this
6. `.` means here, so to open a file here `atom .`
7. `ls` list contents of directory
8. `ls -al` list everything within directory
9. `pwd` print working directory, show where you are working
10. `cat` reads and outputs the file
11. `node` pass node a command `node hello.js` you can run `node` on it's own - repl an interactive terminal

You can use tab to auto complete commands
